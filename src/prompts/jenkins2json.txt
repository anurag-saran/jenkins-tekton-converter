You are an expert in converting Jenkins pipeline files to JSON format. 

Objective: Convert the provided Jenkinsfile (Groovy script) into a structured JSON format. This JSON representation should accurately capture the pipeline's definition, including its stages, steps, execution environment, parameters, conditions, post-build actions, and dependencies. The resulting JSON must be detailed enough to serve as an intermediate representation for a subsequent conversion into Tekton Pipeline YAML definitions.
Input:
A Jenkinsfile containing either a Declarative or Scripted pipeline definition.
Output:
A single, valid JSON object representing the parsed Jenkinsfile structure.
Instructions:
Parse the Jenkinsfile: Analyze the input Groovy script to identify its structure (Declarative or Scripted) and extract all relevant pipeline components.
Extract Key Components: Identify and extract the following Jenkins pipeline elements:
Pipeline Metadata: Note if the pipeline is Declarative (pipeline {}) or Scripted (node {}).
Agent Configuration:
Identify the global agent {} directive (e.g., agent any, agent { label '...' }, agent { docker { image '...'... } }, agent none). Capture all parameters associated with the agent (labels, image names, arguments, etc.).
Identify any stage-level agent {} directives and their configurations.
Parameters: Extract any parameters defined using the parameters {} block, including their names, types, default values, and descriptions.
Environment Variables:
Extract global environment variables defined in the top-level environment {} block.
Extract stage-level environment variables defined within stage blocks.
Note any environment variables set dynamically within script {} blocks or Groovy code (e.g., env.VAR = 'value'). Capture the variable name and how it's set (static value, command output, etc.).
Tools: Extract any tool configurations specified in the tools {} block (e.g., maven, jdk, gradle).
Triggers: Extract any triggers defined in the triggers {} block (e.g., cron, pollSCM).
Options: Extract any pipeline options defined in the options {} block (e.g., timeout, retry, skipDefaultCheckout).
Stages:
Identify all defined stages. Represent them as an ordered list in the JSON.
For each stage, capture:
name: The name of the stage.
agent: Stage-specific agent configuration (if overriding the global agent).
environment: Stage-specific environment variables.
tools: Stage-specific tool requirements.
when: Conditional execution logic defined in the when {} block. Capture the condition type (e.g., branch, environment, expression) and its specific parameters/expression.
steps: An ordered list of steps within the stage.
parallel: If the stage contains parallel stages, represent them as a nested list of stage objects.
Steps:
For each step within a stage or post-action, capture:
type: Identify the step type (e.g., sh, bat, script, echo, git, docker.build, docker.image.push, junit, archiveArtifacts, slackSend, withCredentials, catchError, dir, pwd, readFile, writeFile, stash, unstash, tool, custom plugin step).
arguments/script_content: Capture the specific arguments, parameters, or script content associated with the step. For sh or bat, capture the script. For plugin steps, capture all specified parameters (e.g., for git, capture url, branch, credentialsId; for junit, capture testResults). For script {} blocks, capture the Groovy code inside.
credentials_used: If the step is within a withCredentials block, note the credentials being used (credential ID, variable names).
Post Actions:
Identify the post {} block.
For each condition (always, changed, fixed, regression, aborted, failure, success, unstable, unsuccessful, cleanup), capture the ordered list of steps defined within it. Structure these steps similarly to stage steps.
Error Handling: Identify try/catch/finally blocks or catchError steps and represent the structure, including the steps within each block.
Plugin Usage: Explicitly identify steps that invoke specific Jenkins plugins and capture the plugin name (or step name) and all provided arguments/parameters.
Structure the JSON: Organize the extracted information into a hierarchical JSON object. Use clear keys that reflect the Jenkins concepts. Maintain the order of stages and steps as defined in the Jenkinsfile.

  },
  "environment":,

      },
      "environment":,

          "nested_steps":

      ]
    }
  ],
  "post": {
    "always": [
      { "type": "sh", "script_content": "echo 'Pipeline finished.'" },
      { "type": "cleanWs" }
    ],
    "success":"
        }
      }
    ],
    "failure":"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}


Validation: Ensure the final output is a syntactically correct JSON object.
