# Tekton Validation Errors and Reports - Run 13

--- Validation Report for Run 13, File: /Users/asaran/CascadeProjects/jenkins-tekton-converter/tekton_pipelines/13-j2-tekton-pipeline.yaml ---
## Validation Report

- Structural Integrity: Passed
- Best Practices: 6/10
- Kubernetes Compatibility: Moderate
- Security Considerations: High
- Performance Optimization: Moderate

## Findings and Recommendations:

1. **Best Practices**:
   - The pipeline lacks modularity and reusability by hardcoding specific commands (e.g., 'npm test', 'npm run deploy:staging'). It's recommended to create more generic tasks that can be reused with different parameters.
   - The task names should follow a consistent naming convention for better readability and maintainability.
   - Using specific versions for container images instead of '<required-container-image>' is recommended for stability and reproducibility.

2. **Kubernetes Compatibility**:
   - The workspace naming convention should adhere to Kubernetes resource naming standards (lower case alphanumeric characters and hyphens).
   - Using the 'git-clone' Tekton Hub task instead of a custom git clone script can improve compatibility and maintenance.

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Avoid hardcoded secrets or sensitive information in task definitions. Consider using Kubernetes secrets or secure input parameters.
   - Ensure container images do not run as the root user for improved security.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Introducing parallelism using `runAfter` dependencies can optimize task execution where applicable.
   - Review and optimize task dependencies to minimize unnecessary sequential execution.

## Recommendations:

1. Refactor the pipeline to enhance modularity and reusability. Create generic tasks for build, test, deploy, cleanup, etc., with configurable parameters.
2. Use standard Tekton Task resources (e.g., git-clone) instead of custom scripts for better compatibility and maintenance.
3. Update the container image field in the 'build-task' with a specific version and consider using slim images for efficiency.
4. Improve task naming conventions for clarity and consistency. Also, update workspace names to follow Kubernetes standards.
5. Address security concerns by avoiding hardcoded secrets and ensuring container images do not run as the root user.
6. Optimize task dependencies and consider parallelizing tasks appropriately to improve performance.

--- Second Validation Report for Run 13, File: /Users/asaran/CascadeProjects/jenkins-tekton-converter/tekton_pipelines/13-validated-j2-tekton-pipeline.yaml ---
Fixed the missing closing double quote in the 'cleanup-task' script parameter. Added labels to task definitions for better identification.
