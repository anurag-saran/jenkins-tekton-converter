# Tekton Validation Errors and Reports - Run 9

--- Validation Report for Run 9, File: /Users/asaran/CascadeProjects/jenkins-tekton-converter/tekton_pipelines/9-j2-tekton-pipeline.yaml ---
Validation Report:
- Structural Integrity: Pass
- Best Practices: 5/10
- Kubernetes Compatibility: 4/10
- Security Considerations: 7/10
- Performance Optimization: 3/10

Findings and Recommendations:

1. Structural Integrity:
- YAML syntax is correct.
- API versions and resource kinds are used properly.
- Indentation and formatting are appropriate.

2. Best Practices:
- Tasks are not modular; consider breaking down complex tasks into smaller reusable tasks.
- Workspaces, parameters, and results are not utilized; define them for better task management and flexibility.
- Improve task and pipeline naming conventions for clarity and consistency.
- Instead of using custom scripts, prefer using standard tasks like git-clone for better maintenance.

3. Kubernetes Compatibility:
- Tasks and pipeline names should follow Kubernetes resource naming standards.
- Check for compatibility issues such as invalid references or missing resources.
- Use specific versions for container images instead of 'latest' for better reproducibility.

4. Security Considerations:
- Avoid hardcoded secrets in task definitions; consider using Kubernetes secrets or other secret management tools.
- Ensure container configurations do not run as a root user for better security practices.
- Review permissions and access controls in tasks to minimize security risks.

5. Performance Optimization:
- Implement task parallelization using runAfter in tasks to optimize execution order.
- Review task dependencies to ensure efficient execution flow.
- Optimize resource utilization by defining workspaces to share data between tasks.
